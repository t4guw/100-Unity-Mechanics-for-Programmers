Additionally, it can work in tandem with the Unity Distribution Portal in order to synchronize catalogs and transactions with even more stores.\n\nWith Unity IAP, setting up in-app purchases for your game across multiple app stores has never been easier.\n\nUse one common API to access all stores for free. With just a few lines of code, you can fully understand and optimize your in-game economy.\n\nUnity IAP automatically couples with Unity Analytics enabling you to monitor and act on trends in your revenue and purchase data across multiple platforms.\n\nIncludes client-side receipt validation for Apple App Store and Google Play.\n\nAfter installing this package, please make sure to open the Services Window and enable In-App Purchasing to use its features. In the In-App Purchasing settings, please make sure to import the Asset Store plugin if you have not already done so. This is necessary to include all of the features.",
