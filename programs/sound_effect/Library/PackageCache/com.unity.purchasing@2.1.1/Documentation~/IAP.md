Supported platforms include:

* iOS App Store

For instructions on using the features in the Purchasing package, refer to the [Unity IAP section of
the Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html).

The package is supported by Unity 2018.4.18f1+ and includes functionality previously included in
earlier Package Manager packages. When upgrading existing projects to
2018.4 or later, older, redundant packages should be removed from the project.
