# Rotate Object to Cursor in 2D

## Description
This mechanic shows how to rotate an object towards a cursor, but can be modified to rotate towards any object. This could be extremely useful when developing a top-down shooter, or when you want objects to constantly look at a player.

## Implementation
First ensure the player has a Rigidbody2D component attached to it. The example program has an option to either instantly rotate towards the cursor, or rotate over time. To change between these two options, change the "instant" variable. To change the rotation speed, modify the "rotateSpeed" variable.

    using UnityEngine;

    public class RotatePlayer : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public Camera cam;
        Vector2 mousePos;
        public Rigidbody2D rb2d;
        public float rotateSpeed = 50f;
        public bool instant = false;

        private void Start()
        {
            rb2d = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();   
        }

        void Update()
        {
            mousePos = cam.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
        }

        void FixedUpdate()
        {
            Vector2 lookDirection = mousePos - new Vector2(transform.position.x, transform.position.y);
            float angle = Mathf.Atan2(lookDirection.y, lookDirection.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg - 90f;

            if (instant)
            {
                rb2d.rotation = angle;
            }
            else
            {
                Quaternion qTo = Quaternion.Euler(new Vector3(0, 0, angle));
                transform.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(transform.rotation, qTo, rotateSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
            }
        }
    }
