# Text Follow Player 2D & Hide/Show UI

## Description
This mechanic shows how to make text follow a player, as well as hiding and showing a UI element on key press.
This is helpful if you want, for example, a player's name to always be above their head. Hiding and showing a UI element could
be helpful when trying to show a map on key press.

## Implementation
- To make text follow a player, the steps are done in the Unity Editor. 
1. Under the player object, create a new Canvas as a child, and in that canvas, create a Text element. 
2. Set the Canvas render mode to "World Space."
3. Anchor the text to the top middle, or any other desired spot. Position and format the text as desired.

- To hide and show a UI element on keypress, add the following simple script to the element you want to hide/show:

        using UnityEngine;
        using UnityEngine.UI;

        public class Show_Hide : MonoBehaviour
        {
        
            void Update()
            {
                if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.M))
                {
                    this.GetComponent<Image>().enabled = !this.GetComponent<Image>().enabled;
                }
            }
        }
