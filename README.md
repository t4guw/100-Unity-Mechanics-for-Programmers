# 100 Unity Mechanics for Programmers
Building Unity mechanics structured as a set of challenges. 100 sample programs where each program demonstrates a different mechanic. Visit the website for WebGL builds [here](https://t4guw.github.io/100-Unity-Mechanics-for-Programmers/)

## Each mechanic has its own zip file in programs/ which can be downloaded. The full repository is ~2GBs.
